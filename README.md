## 🚀 Overview

This project is an AI-powered SQL chatbot that allows users to interact with SQLite or MySQL databases using natural language queries.

The application uses:
- LangChain SQL Agent
- Groq LLM
- Streamlit interface

Users can ask questions in plain English, and the chatbot automatically generates and executes SQL queries to retrieve results from the database.

## 🧠 How It Works

```text
User Query
   ↓
LangChain SQL Agent
   ↓
LLM generates SQL query
   ↓
Database execution
   ↓
Results returned to user
```
